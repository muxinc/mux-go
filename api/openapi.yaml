    An asset refers to a piece of media content that is stored or is being live streamed through the Mux system. An asset always has a duration and one or more tracks (audio, video, and text data).

    The media content of an asset cannot be updated once created, however an asset can be used to create another asset, and can be modified within that process.

    A Live Stream represents a unique live stream of video being pushed to Mux. It includes configuration details (a Stream Key) for live broadcasting software/hardware and a Playback ID for playing the stream anywhere. Currently, RTMP is the only supported method of ingesting video. Use rtmp://live.mux.com/app with the Live Stream's Stream Key for getting the video into Mux, and use https://stream.mux.com with the Live Stream's Playback ID for playback.

    A Live Stream can be used once for a specific event, or re-used forever. If you're building an application like Facebook Live or Twitch, you could create one Live Stream per user. This allows them the configure their broadcasting software once, and the Live Stream Playback ID will always show their latest stream.

    Each RTMP session creates a new video asset automatically. You can set up a webhook to be notified each time a broadcast (or Live Stream RTMP session) begins or ends with the video.live_stream.active and video.live_stream.idle events respectively. Assets that are created from a Live Stream have the same behavior as other Assets you create.

    A URL signing key is used as the secret when signing any Mux URL. Mux requires a [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/) as the value of the token query parameter. The token query parameter must be set for URLs that reference a playback ID with a signed playback policy.

    Direct upload allows you to push assets directly to Mux storage instead of needing to go through your own first. When you create a new direct upload, we'll give you back a signed URL for a Google Cloud Storage bucket. Their storage API is S3 compatible, so whatever tool you use to upload to either GCS or S3 should work, just remember you're probably uploading large video files and should [take advantage of things like resumable or multipart uploads](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/how-tos/resumable-upload).

    Particularly for customers that deal with a lot of user-generated content, it's common to expect quite a few abandoned uploads. To keep those abandoned uploads from cluttering up your asset lists, we don't create an asset for you until the upload is complete. Once that asset is created, you can expect all of the normal asset-related webhooks.

        The Mux Video API uses an Access Token and Secret Key for authentication. If you haven't already, [generate a new Access Token](https://dashboard.mux.com/settings/access-tokens) in the Access Token settings of your Mux account dashboard.

        Once you have an Access Token ID and Secret, you can then simply include those as the username (id) and password (secret) in the same way you use traditional basic auth.
