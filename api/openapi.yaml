    An asset refers to a piece of media content that is stored or is being live streamed through the Mux system. An asset always has a duration and one or more tracks (audio, video, and text data).

    The media content of an asset cannot be updated once created, however an asset can be used to create another asset, and can be modified within that process.

    A Live Stream represents a unique live stream of video being pushed to Mux. It includes configuration details (a Stream Key) for live broadcasting software/hardware and a Playback ID for playing the stream anywhere. Currently, RTMP is the only supported method of ingesting video. Use rtmp://global-live.mux.com:5222/app with the Live Stream's Stream Key for getting the video into Mux, and use https://stream.mux.com with the Live Stream's Playback ID for playback.

    A Live Stream can be used once for a specific event, or re-used forever. If you're building an application like Facebook Live or Twitch, you could create one Live Stream per user. This allows them to configure their broadcasting software once, and the Live Stream Playback ID will always show their latest stream.

    Each RTMP session creates a new video asset automatically. You can set up a webhook to be notified each time a broadcast (or Live Stream RTMP session) begins or ends with the video.live_stream.active and video.live_stream.idle events respectively. Assets that are created from a Live Stream have the same behavior as other Assets you create.

    requires a [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/) as the value of the token query parameter.
    The token query parameter must be set for URLs that reference a playback ID with
    a signed playback policy.

    Direct upload allows you to push assets directly to Mux storage instead of needing to go through your own first. When you create a new direct upload, we'll give you back a signed URL for a Google Cloud Storage bucket. Their storage API is S3 compatible, so whatever tool you use to upload to either GCS or S3 should work, just remember you're probably uploading large video files and should [take advantage of things like resumable or multipart uploads](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/how-tos/resumable-upload).

    Particularly for customers that deal with a lot of user-generated content, it's common to expect quite a few abandoned uploads. To keep those abandoned uploads from cluttering up your asset lists, we don't create an asset for you until the upload is complete. Once that asset is created, you can expect all of the normal asset-related webhooks.

    The Delivery Usage API allows you to get delivery/streaming usage details for each asset and across all assets. Delivery usage details are aggregated every hour at the top of the hour and can be requested for a specified time window within the last 90 days starting at 12 hours prior to when the request is made.

    Assets are ordered by delivery usage starting with the one with the highest usage. Only assets with delivery usage greater than 0 seconds are returned in the response.

        (Optional) End the live stream recording immediately instead of waiting for the reconnect_window. `EXT-X-ENDLIST` tag is added to the HLS manifest which notifies the player that this live stream is over.

        Mux does not close the encoder connection immediately. Encoders are often configured to re-establish connections immediately which would result in a new recorded asset. For this reason, Mux waits for 60s before closing the connection with the encoder. This 60s timeframe is meant to give encoder operators a chance to disconnect from their end.

        Disables a live stream, making it reject incoming RTMP streams until re-enabled. The API also ends the live stream recording immediately when active. Ending the live stream recording adds the `EXT-X-ENDLIST` tag to the HLS manifest which notifies the player that this live stream is over.

        Mux also closes the encoder connection immediately. Any attempt from the encoder to re-establish connection will fail till the live stream is re-enabled.

        vertical_align:
          description: Where the vertical positioning of the overlay/watermark should
            begin from. Defaults to `"top"`

          type: string
        vertical_margin:
          description: The distance from the vertical_align starting point and the
            image's closest edge. Can be expressed as a percent ("10%") or as a pixel
            value ("100px"). Negative values will move the overlay offscreen. In the
            case of 'middle', a positive value will shift the overlay towards the
            bottom and and a negative value will shift it towards the top.
          type: string
        horizontal_align:
          description: Where the horizontal positioning of the overlay/watermark should

            image's closest edge. Can be expressed as a percent ("10%") or as a pixel
            value ("100px"). Negative values will move the overlay offscreen. In the
            case of 'center', a positive value will shift the image towards the right
            and and a negative value will shift it towards the left.
          type: string
        width:
          description: How wide the overlay should appear. Can be expressed as a percent
            ("10%") or as a pixel value ("100px"). If both width and height are left
            blank the width will be the true pixels of the image, applied as if the
            video has been scaled to fit a 1920x1080 frame. If height is supplied
            with no width, the width will scale proportionally to the height.
          type: string
        height:
          description: How tall the overlay should appear. Can be expressed as a percent
            ("10%") or as a pixel value ("100px"). If both width and height are left
            blank the height will be the true pixels of the image, applied as if the
            video has been scaled to fit a 1920x1080 frame. If width is supplied with
            no height, the height will scale proportionally to the width.

        The Mux Video API uses an Access Token and Secret Key for authentication. If you haven't already, [generate a new Access Token](https://dashboard.mux.com/settings/access-tokens) in the Access Token settings of your Mux account dashboard.

        Once you have an Access Token ID and Secret, you can then simply include those as the username (id) and password (secret) in the same way you use traditional basic auth.
