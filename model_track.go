type Track struct {
	// Unique identifier for the Track
	Id string `json:"id,omitempty"`
	// The type of track
	Type string `json:"type,omitempty"`
	// The duration in seconds of the track media. This parameter is not set for `text` type tracks. This field is optional and may not be set. The top level `duration` field of an asset will always be set.
	Duration float64 `json:"duration,omitempty"`
	// The maximum width in pixels available for the track. Only set for the `video` type track.
	MaxWidth int64 `json:"max_width,omitempty"`
	// The maximum height in pixels available for the track. Only set for the `video` type track.
	MaxHeight int64 `json:"max_height,omitempty"`
	// The maximum frame rate available for the track. Only set for the `video` type track. This field may return `-1` if the frame rate of the input cannot be reliably determined.
	MaxFrameRate float64 `json:"max_frame_rate,omitempty"`
	// The maximum number of audio channels the track supports. Only set for the `audio` type track.
	MaxChannels int64 `json:"max_channels,omitempty"`
	// Only set for the `audio` type track.
	MaxChannelLayout string `json:"max_channel_layout,omitempty"`
	// This parameter is only set for `text` type tracks.
	TextType string `json:"text_type,omitempty"`
	// The source of the text contained in a Track of type `text`. Valid `text_source` values are listed below. * `uploaded`: Tracks uploaded to Mux as caption or subtitle files using the Create Asset Track API. * `embedded`: Tracks extracted from an embedded stream of CEA-608 closed captions. * `generated_vod`: Tracks generated by automatic speech recognition on an on-demand asset. * `generated_live`: Tracks generated by automatic speech recognition on a live stream configured with `generated_subtitles`. If an Asset has both `generated_live` and `generated_live_final` tracks that are `ready`, then only the `generated_live_final` track will be included during playback. * `generated_live_final`: Tracks generated by automatic speech recognition on a live stream using `generated_subtitles`. The accuracy, timing, and formatting of these subtitles is improved compared to the corresponding `generated_live` tracks. However, `generated_live_final` tracks will not be available in `ready` status until the live stream ends. If an Asset has both `generated_live` and `generated_live_final` tracks that are `ready`, then only the `generated_live_final` track will be included during playback.
	TextSource string `json:"text_source,omitempty"`
	// The language code value represents [BCP 47](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) specification compliant value. For example, `en` for English or `en-US` for the US version of English. This parameter is only set for `text` and `audio` track types.
	LanguageCode string `json:"language_code,omitempty"`
	// The name of the track containing a human-readable description. The HLS manifest will associate a subtitle `text` or `audio` track with this value. For example, the value should be \"English\" for a subtitle text track for the `language_code` value of `en-US`. This parameter is only set for `text` and `audio` track types.
	Name string `json:"name,omitempty"`
	// Indicates the track provides Subtitles for the Deaf or Hard-of-hearing (SDH). This parameter is only set tracks where `type` is `text` and `text_type` is `subtitles`.
	ClosedCaptions bool `json:"closed_captions,omitempty"`
	// Arbitrary user-supplied metadata set for the track either when creating the asset or track. This parameter is only set for `text` type tracks. Max 255 characters.
	Passthrough string `json:"passthrough,omitempty"`
	// The status of the track. This parameter is only set for `text` type tracks.
	Status string `json:"status,omitempty"`
	// For an audio track, indicates that this is the primary audio track, ingested from the main input for this asset. The primary audio track cannot be deleted.
	Primary bool `json:"primary,omitempty"`
