	// Specify what level of support for mp4 playback.  * The `capped-1080p` option produces a single MP4 file, called `capped-1080p.mp4`, with the video resolution capped at 1080p. This option produces an `audio.m4a` file for an audio-only asset. * The `audio-only` option produces a single M4A file, called `audio.m4a` for a video or an audio-only asset. MP4 generation will error when this option is specified for a video-only asset. * The `audio-only,capped-1080p` option produces both the `audio.m4a` and `capped-1080p.mp4` files. Only the `capped-1080p.mp4` file is produced for a video-only asset, while only the `audio.m4a` file is produced for an audio-only asset.  The `standard`(deprecated) option produces up to three MP4 files with different levels of resolution (`high.mp4`, `medium.mp4`, `low.mp4`, or `audio.m4a` for an audio-only asset).  `none` will delete the MP4s from the asset in question.
