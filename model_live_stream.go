type LiveStream struct {
	// Unique identifier for the Live Stream. Max 255 characters.
	Id string `json:"id,omitempty"`
	// Time the Live Stream was created, defined as a Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch).
	CreatedAt string `json:"created_at,omitempty"`
	// Unique key used for streaming to a Mux RTMP endpoint. This should be considered as sensitive as credentials, anyone with this stream key can begin streaming.
	StreamKey string `json:"stream_key,omitempty"`
	// The Asset that is currently being created if there is an active broadcast.
	ActiveAssetId string `json:"active_asset_id,omitempty"`
	// An array of strings with the most recent Asset IDs that were created from this Live Stream. The most recently generated Asset ID is the last entry in the list.
	RecentAssetIds []string         `json:"recent_asset_ids,omitempty"`
	Status         LiveStreamStatus `json:"status,omitempty"`
	// An array of Playback ID objects. Use these to create HLS playback URLs. See [Play your videos](https://docs.mux.com/guides/play-your-videos) for more details.
	PlaybackIds      []PlaybackId       `json:"playback_ids,omitempty"`
	NewAssetSettings CreateAssetRequest `json:"new_asset_settings,omitempty"`
	// Arbitrary user-supplied metadata set for the asset. Max 255 characters.
	Passthrough string `json:"passthrough,omitempty"`
	// The live stream only processes the audio track if the value is set to true. Mux drops the video track if broadcasted.
	AudioOnly bool `json:"audio_only,omitempty"`
	// Describes the embedded closed caption configuration of the incoming live stream.
	EmbeddedSubtitles []LiveStreamEmbeddedSubtitleSettings `json:"embedded_subtitles,omitempty"`
	// Configure the incoming live stream to include subtitles created with automatic speech recognition. Each Asset created from a live stream with `generated_subtitles` configured will automatically receive two text tracks. The first of these will have a `text_source` value of `generated_live`, and will be available with `ready` status as soon as the stream is live. The second text track will have a `text_source` value of `generated_live_final` and will contain subtitles with improved accuracy, timing, and formatting. However, `generated_live_final` tracks will not be available in `ready` status until the live stream ends. If an Asset has both `generated_live` and `generated_live_final` tracks that are `ready`, then only the `generated_live_final` track will be included during playback.
	GeneratedSubtitles []LiveStreamGeneratedSubtitleSettings `json:"generated_subtitles,omitempty"`
	// When live streaming software disconnects from Mux, either intentionally or due to a drop in the network, the Reconnect Window is the time in seconds that Mux should wait for the streaming software to reconnect before considering the live stream finished and completing the recorded asset. **Max**: 1800s (30 minutes).  If not specified directly, Standard Latency streams have a Reconnect Window of 60 seconds; Reduced and Low Latency streams have a default of 0 seconds, or no Reconnect Window. For that reason, we suggest specifying a value other than zero for Reduced and Low Latency streams.  Reduced and Low Latency streams with a Reconnect Window greater than zero will insert slate media into the recorded asset while waiting for the streaming software to reconnect or when there are brief interruptions in the live stream media. When using a Reconnect Window setting higher than 60 seconds with a Standard Latency stream, we highly recommend enabling slate with the `use_slate_for_standard_latency` option.
	ReconnectWindow float32 `json:"reconnect_window,omitempty"`
	// By default, Standard Latency live streams do not have slate media inserted while waiting for live streaming software to reconnect to Mux. Setting this to true enables slate insertion on a Standard Latency stream.
	UseSlateForStandardLatency bool `json:"use_slate_for_standard_latency,omitempty"`
	// The URL of the image file that Mux should download and use as slate media during interruptions of the live stream media. This file will be downloaded each time a new recorded asset is created from the live stream. If this is not set, the default slate media will be used.
	ReconnectSlateUrl string `json:"reconnect_slate_url,omitempty"`
	// This field is deprecated. Please use `latency_mode` instead. Latency is the time from when the streamer transmits a frame of video to when you see it in the player. Set this if you want lower latency for your live stream. See the [Reduce live stream latency guide](https://docs.mux.com/guides/reduce-live-stream-latency) to understand the tradeoffs.
	ReducedLatency bool `json:"reduced_latency,omitempty"`
	// This field is deprecated. Please use `latency_mode` instead. Latency is the time from when the streamer transmits a frame of video to when you see it in the player. Setting this option will enable compatibility with the LL-HLS specification for low-latency streaming. This typically has lower latency than Reduced Latency streams, and cannot be combined with Reduced Latency.
	LowLatency bool `json:"low_latency,omitempty"`
	// Each Simulcast Target contains configuration details to broadcast (or \"restream\") a live stream to a third-party streaming service. [See the Stream live to 3rd party platforms guide](https://docs.mux.com/guides/stream-live-to-3rd-party-platforms).
	SimulcastTargets []SimulcastTarget `json:"simulcast_targets,omitempty"`
	// Latency is the time from when the streamer transmits a frame of video to when you see it in the player. Set this as an alternative to setting low latency or reduced latency flags.
	LatencyMode string `json:"latency_mode,omitempty"`
	// True means this live stream is a test live stream. Test live streams can be used to help evaluate the Mux Video APIs for free. There is no limit on the number of test live streams, but they are watermarked with the Mux logo, and limited to 5 minutes. The test live stream is disabled after the stream is active for 5 mins and the recorded asset also deleted after 24 hours.
	Test bool `json:"test,omitempty"`
	// The time in seconds a live stream may be continuously active before being disconnected. Defaults to 12 hours.
	MaxContinuousDuration int32 `json:"max_continuous_duration,omitempty"`
	// Unique key used for encrypting a stream to a Mux SRT endpoint.
	SrtPassphrase string `json:"srt_passphrase,omitempty"`
