# I appreciate this isn't the cleanest workflow, but it's the neatest I can get it while we're
# still using dep to manage dependencies. If we move to go modules this can be cleaned up a lot.
# I'd love to use a nicer checkout path, but GitHub actions won't let you use anythingÂ above
# /home/runner/work/mux-go/mux-go/, so /home/runner/work/mux-go/mux-go/go it is!
