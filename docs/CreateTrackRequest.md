Mux supports most audio file formats and codecs, but for fastest processing, you should [use standard inputs wherever possible](https://docs.mux.com/guides/video/minimize-processing-time). * For &#x60;text&#x60; tracks, the URL is the location of subtitle/captions file. Mux supports [SubRip Text (SRT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip) and [Web Video Text Tracks](https://www.w3.org/TR/webvtt1/) formats for ingesting Subtitles and Closed Captions.  |
